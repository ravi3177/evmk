               Events create opportunities for people to connect with an area, spend time together, celebrate and experience the diversity of cultures and foster creativity and innovation. They allow a community to come alive and provide an opportunity for a destination to showcase its tourism experience and increase economic activity.
Most importantly, events create a sense of fun and vibrancy, resulting in a strong sense of community connectivity, pride and a sense of place

            <p>There are different criteria for classification of events. The basic one classifies events as planned and unplanned.
Planned events are the subject of study of event management and they require setup, management, executives and certain length of time.
Unplanned events are accidents, natural disasters and other similar, and they will not be taken into consideration in this unit.

                <h5>Learn: we want to get to know you</h5>
                <p>What is your business about? What are your challenges? What are the issues that your members or
                    clients are dealing with? By thoroughly understanding your company’s leadership culture, how your

                    the
                    first step for us is about getting to know you and your business.</p>

                <p>Finally, this is where our event management expertise comes into play. At our core, we love events.
                    We love the on-site details, production plans, schedules, deadlines and to do lists that come along

                    coordination, we ensure every detail is looked after. Managing your event using a strategic overall
                    plan and a methodical management approach allows you to rest easy. Knowing that every last detail is
                    looked after will allow you to focus on your attendees and stakeholders at the event. Let us look
